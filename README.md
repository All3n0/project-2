## User story
1. As a user, you’re able to see images, descriptions and prices of items you want to buy.

3. As a user, you’re able to add items to your cart.

## Challenges 
1. API limits, ie you may not be able to see all products on sale 
2. Data inaccuracies, eg, wrong pricing, wrong sizes of items, images may not match the product 
3. Cross browser compatibility issues, different browsers interpret HTML, CSS & JavaScript differently hence different results 
4. Dependency issues, that is some dependencies are no longer maintained by create-react-app. This can cause the application to crash at any time.
